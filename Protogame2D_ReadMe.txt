The ReadMe file for Starship:

Assignment 3:

Known Issues:

- Attract screen not implemented
- Levels/Waves not implemented
- Debugging mode for player ship was broken (Over engineered changes to my original implementation resulted in broken code. So much for "optimizing")
- Lack of Xbox Controller debugging support (I'm not using the "it wasn't in the doc" as an excuse for it)

How To Use:

Keyboard controls:
- Use the left and right arrow keys to turn the ship
- Use the up arrow key to accelerate in the direction the ship is facing
- press 'N' to respawn
- press 'space' to shoot bullets from the ship
- press 'A' to spawn another asteroid
- press 'F8' to restart the game
- press 'F1' to toggle developer mode (draws the cosmetic and physics discs for all the entities in the game)

Xbox controls:
- Use the left analog stick to move
- Use the A key to shoot
- Press the Start button to respawn

Deep Learning:

This assignment was probably the best learning I've had so far. I took the worst possible route by not planning features based on the time I had to implement them. My focus
was to re-organize my code to get to an "optimal" structure but that faded as the project was in progress. Phase 1 of my assignment was implementing the Xbox controller 
which went well but Phase 2 was trying to adhere to good coding practices which I failed to achieve to a satisfactory level. I ignored the whole "KISS" approach and began 
trying to re-structure my code from the ground up. This resulted in me breaking my existing features and over complicating things.

The most frustrating part (and the part I learnt most from) was my implementation of player lives. I implemented player lives in an overly complex manner and restructuring 
most of my original code for PlayerShip. This resulted in hours of frustration and a list of broken features. If I had considered the "KISS" and "we are millionairs" concepts
before getting to optimizing my code, I probably would have had a complete assignment. I over engineered and added unwanted complexity to my project. Although I basically
didn't follow anything I was taught in class nor my previous assignment learnings, I now know the value of it (which probably sounds ridiculous). Overall I learned that 
it's important to work smarter than harder and that inefficiencies aren't so bad, but over complication definitely is. My focus was way off on this assignment but weirdly that
seemed to be insightful in the end.
